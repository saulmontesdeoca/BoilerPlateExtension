## Inspiration

For a lot of developers writing code for full stack applications from scratch can take time and that is why a lot of developers use commands like create react app or they search for boilerplate codes online. A lot of times people have to write a lot of repititive code for example creating sign up, login modules in full stack applications or create files like README.md. 
We want to make it super simple and one place from where the developers can download boilerplate code of their full stack language tech stacks of choice and also find a common space to directly utlize commonly used components and directly use in their project. 

## What it does

Code Helify is a react application that gives ability to developers to download Boilerplate codes for full stack applications based on their tech stack of choice. We give a simple drop down menu list to select a front end, backend and package manager of choice to download the boiler plate code based on the choice of the developer. 

We have also added a code snippets section from which the user can simply copy the mostly commonly used code snippets in various tech stacks like signup, login components in React, Node etc. We have also added snippets of common files used by developers like README.md in a simple to use application.  

## How we built it

Our application is a React.js based app that uses React Code Snippet modules to showcase code snippets and have a clip board functionality. 
We also used Jest for testing. 

## Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge was definitely understanding about testing and integrating Jest in our project as none of us had experience with Jest and testing React Applications. 

## Accomplishments that we are proud of

We were able to complete the project and deploy it. We also learnt about Testing in React Applications using Jest and added a few scripts for testing a few of the components in our project. 

## What We learned

Jest for Testing React Components, Github Actions and Workflows
